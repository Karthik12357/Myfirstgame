# Myfirstgame
Installation of pygame on your machine to run my game is essential. It can be installed if you have python installed previously.
The command is 
$ pip install pygame
Then you can clone the file on your computer using any way you want(VS code has been tested by me and works 100% percent fine on it after cloning).But it requires GIT to be installed.
Thanks for downloading.
